# Architecture boundary

AgentPermit4j owns the deterministic boundary between a proposed tool call and an external side effect.

## Core invariants

1. Model text never grants permission.
2. Approval is bound to the normalized invocation fingerprint.
3. A policy decision is explainable by stable reason codes.
4. Retries cannot duplicate a side effect.
5. Audit events describe decisions and outcomes without exposing secrets.
6. Sample tools remain outside the reusable core.

## Context model

A decision is based on `subject + action + resource + context`. Risk is not a constant attached to a tool name; it also depends on normalized arguments, principal attributes, resource attributes, tenant, and environment.

## First implementation boundary

The first vertical slice uses Java policies and in-memory stores. It proves semantics before adding Spring Boot convenience modules or distributed adapters.
